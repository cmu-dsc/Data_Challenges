## November Data Challenge
# Poll Believability
When: Nov. 2, 5-7PM
Where: WEH 5403
In an ensemble of polls collected by Fivethirtyeight, any of the top 5 Democrats has a 10 point lead versus Trump. However, the 2016 elections showed an even stronger leaning towards the Democratic party, and yet Trump still succeeded in the elections. This begs the question--to what extent are current polls useful in truly predicting the outcome of elections?

## Hints:
* familiarize yourself with survey methodology
* visualize historical polling data and check correlation with current polls
* create a biased model and fit for it using the polls vs the results from the 2016 election

# Faculty Course Evaluations at CMU

Every end of the semester, we as CMU students fill out Faculty Course Evaluations (FCE’s), that ask a couple of questions per course in order to gauge the rigor and the teaching quality. The survey includes the following:
How many hours a week did you spend on this course?
* From 1–5, what was the professor’s interest in student learning?
* From 1–5, did the professor clearly explain the course requirements?
* From 1–5, did the professor have clear learning objectives & goals?
* From 1–5, did the professor demonstrate the importance of the subject matter?
* From 1–5, how well did the professor explain the subject matter of the course?
* From 1–5, what is the overall teaching rating you give the professor?
* From 1–5, what is the overall course rating?

We can also get a couple of different fields, including # of possible respondents, number of people who did end up responding, year, semester, college, department, the professor teaching the course, and the course section as well.

Some questions to consider:
* Which course has the most variable ratings?
* Are people taking more tech classes overall?
